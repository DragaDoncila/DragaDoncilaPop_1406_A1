    <h3>Volleyball</h3>
    <p>Around the world, 800 million people play volleyball at least once every week. Volleyball is safe, fun and easy
    to pick up. Volleyball is a "choose your own adventure" sport. You can have a slower game for those who want low impact
    while still getting your heart pumping. Alternately, you can up the competition and make for an intense and exciting match.</p>
    <p>Beach volleyball is suitable for people of all ages and fitness levels, men and women alike. Anyone considering
    starting a new sport or exercise regime should see their doctor first.</p>

    <h3>Rules</h3>
    <p>Volleyball is played by two teams, each taking one side of a court divided by a net. Originating in the US,
    volleyball has been rapidly gaining popularity recently. The object of the game is to ground the ball in the opponent's
    side of the court, while keeping the ball in the air with the help of your own team. </p>
    <p>The player in the back-right of the court serves the ball (puts it into play) over the
    net and into the opposing team's half. The team is then allowed to touch the ball three times (max) in an effort to
    get it back over the net. No player can consecutively touch the ball, except when attempting a block. The rally continues
    until the ball touches the ground, goes out of court, or a fault is committed.</p>
    <p>When a rally is won, the winning team scores a point and the right to serve. The players shuffle one position to the left
    to switch service. Each game is won by the first team to get to 25 points with at least a 2 point advantage. Best out of three (or five)
    games wins the match. A deciding game is won in 15 points, with at least a 2 point advantage.</p>
