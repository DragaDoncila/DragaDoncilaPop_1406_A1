<h1>CP1406 - Assignment 1 - Project Plan</h1>
<p><strong>Name:</strong> Draga Doncila Pop</p>
<h2>Goals</h2>
<p>This website is intended to increase custom (of both players and visitors) at Slammers Beach Volleyball (by about 50%)
    with particular focus on a younger age group and new families.</p>
<h2>Success Evaluation</h2>
  <ol>
    <li>The number of players weekly should be measured, with an increase to ~150 players/wk considered successful</li>
    <li>The average age of new players should be calculated through survey, and should decrease in comparison to pre-website average
      attendee age (35-50) to be considered successful</li>
  </ol>
<h2>Target Audience</h2>
<p>Males and females aged 15 to 30 of any fitness level. The site will focus on the socialising opportunities at Slammers,
(from hiring for functions, to playing games, to happy hour) to increase appeal to the target audience. Much focus will be
placed on acquiring new registered users, so sign up form will be easy to fill in and heavily advertised.</p>
